# Personal blog

Hi, here is my [blog](https://tsinghua-gongjing.github.io/) to record some of my learning notes in study and problems met in research. Most of the posts are for my own use, so the format or content may be not professional. If you have any suggestions or find any issues, please drop me a line by email (<gongj15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn>). 

The main goal to set up the blog is to track my study. I believe writing what you learn and sharing what you have will greatly advance your understandings.

The topics will cover 3 aspects:

1. Genomics or biology: concepts, papers, bioinformatics
2. Progamming: text processing, sequencing data analysis, visualization
3. Reading: book on scientific topic, interesting novel

The whole website is based on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), designed by [panxw](http://www.panxw.com).
