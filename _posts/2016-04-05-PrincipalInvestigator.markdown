### RNA biology

---------------------------

**Mitchell Guttman**, California Institute of Technology, [labpage](http://guttmanlab.caltech.edu/index.php)

* RAP-DNA, RAP-RNA
* The presence of thousands of functional large non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the mammalian genome represents a missing component in our understanding of genome regulation.
* Our lab aims to understand how lncRNAs control gene expression programs and cell state decisions in the context of mouse embryonic stem cells. We are an integrated team of experimental and computational biologists who work together to address these questions using genomic approaches in conjunction with biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, and computational biology.

**Xiangdong Fu**, UCSD, [labpage](http://cmm.ucsd.edu/fu/)

* The Fu laboratory is interested in molecular and cell biology of RNA metabolism and regulation in higher eukaryotic cells. Current research interests in the Fu lab include the regulation of alternative splicing, functional RNA elements in mammalian genomes, transcription/splicing coupling, nuclear architecture, and cellular reprogramming.

### RNA secondary structure

---------------------------

**Alain Laederach**, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, [labpage](https://ribosnitch.bio.unc.edu/research/)

* RibosNitch, SNPfold
* The Laederach Lab is interested in better understanding the relationship between RNA structure and folding and human disease. We use a combination of computational and experimental approaches to study the process of RNA folding and in the cells. In particular, we develop novel approaches to analyze and interpret chemical and enzymatic mapping data on a genomic scale. We aim to fundamentally understand the role of RNA structure in controlling post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, and to interpret structure as a secondary layer of information (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7485/full/505621a.html).  We are particularly interested in how human genetic variation affects RNA regulatory structure. We investigate the relationship between disease-associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms occurring in Human UTRs and their effect on RNA structure to determine if they form a RiboSNitch.

### RNA-RNA interaction

**Zhipeng Lu**, University of Southern California School of Pharmacy, [labpage](https://zhipenglulab.org/)

* PARIS
* Our research is focused on “RNA machines” in living cells. We develop and apply novel technologies to understand the structures and functions of RNA molecules in basic cellular processes, with the ultimate goal of treating human diseases, including genetic disorders, cancers and viral infections.

### RNA-protein interaction

**Gene Yeo**, UCSD, [labpage](https://yeolab.github.io/)

* eCLIP, CLIPPER
* how RNA binding proteins and RNA modifications affect cellular homeostasis in human pluripotent stem cells.
* how defects in RNA binding proteins cause neurological disease, such as ALS.
* post-transcriptional processing of RNAs by multiple mechanisms.
* develop new computational approaches to decipher biological meaning from thousands of single-cell RNA-seq/proteomics data.

### RNA-DNA interaction

---------------------------

**Sheng Zhong**, UCSD, [labpage](http://systemsbio.ucsd.edu/index.html)

* We study gene regulation and cellular behavior by developing statistical and experimental methods. Our primary goal is to develop new technologies to map molecular networks, including RNA-RNA interactome [[MARIO, Nat Comm, 2016]](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12023), RNA-chromatin interactome [[MAGIR, Curr Biol, 2017]](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30011-8), and protein-protein interactome. Our secondary quest is to model the variations of these networks in three axes, namely developmental time, personal difference, and evolutionary change. Our major tools include epigenomic and single-cell assays, single-molecule imaging, statistical modeling, and large scale computation.

### Stress granule

**Roy Parker**, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO BOULDER, [labpage](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/parkergroup/)

* Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control mRNA stability and translation rate in eukaryotic cells, using yeast as a model system.

**Jernej Ule**, UCL/Crick institute, [labpage](http://www.ulelab.info/index.php)

* HiCLIP, iCLIP, RNP granule
* The goal of our research group is to reveal **how RNPs regulate the life cycle of mRNAs** in neurons, and how this can go wrong in neurologic diseases. To study the assembly of RNPs, we obtain detailed maps of protein-RNA binding sites by using transcriptomic techniques. For this purpose, we developed the nucleotide-resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), which identifies protein-RNA contacts by using a series of steps, as described in the figure above. We are further developing similar methods, as well as computational tools to interpret the high-throughput sequencing data. Thereby, we gain a comprehensive view of RNP assembly and dynamics within intact cells.
